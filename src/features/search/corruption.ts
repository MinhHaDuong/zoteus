/**
 * The index the server holds when its database could not be opened.
 *
 * Not an empty index, and that is the whole design. An empty one answers every query with
 * no hits, which reads to a caller exactly like a library holding nothing — a silent wrong
 * answer in place of a loud right one. So every operation that would read or write the
 * index refuses with the message above, and the rest of the server is untouched: item
 * reads, bibliographies and attachment full text go to Zotero and never through here, so
 * one bad cache file no longer takes the whole MCP server down with it.
 *
 * It extends `SearchIndexBase` rather than implementing `SearchIndex` directly, so that
 * everything a caller reads but this class has no opinion about — the embedder identity and
 * its degradation reasons, the counts, the build-status shape — keeps coming from the same
 * place it comes from on a healthy index. A hand-written copy drifts the first time a field
 * is added to the interface, and drifts silently, because the missing field is optional.
