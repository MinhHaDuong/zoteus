# Files, full-text, sync, groups & export

M4 rounds out library coverage with five tools; `zotero_attach_file` and `zotero_annotate` were added later and write through the Zotero desktop app when one is reachable, falling back to the cloud Web API when it is not.

## `zotero_groups`
Lists the group libraries your key can access (id, name, type, item count, edit permissions). Pass a returned id as `library_id` (with `library_type:"group"`) to other tools to operate on a group library.

## `zotero_export`
Exports items in a machine-readable bibliographic format and returns the raw text:
`bibtex`, `biblatex`, `ris`, `csljson`, `csv`, `mods`, `tei`, `coins`, `rdf_bibliontology`, `rdf_dc`, `rdf_zotero`, `refer`, `wikipedia`, `bookmarks`. Narrow with `item_keys`, `collection_key`, `q`, or `item_type`. A `limit` is always applied (export formats require it). For styled, human-readable citations in a CSL style (APA, IEEE, …), use the citation tools.

## `zotero_fulltext`
Read or write attachment full text (only attachment items have it):
- `get` — extracted text + indexing stats (`found:false` when none).
- `set` — store extracted text (`content` + char/page counts).
- `since` — map of attachment keys whose full text changed after a library version (for incremental indexing).

> `get` and `since` are **routed** like every other read: Zotero 7+ serves the same `/fulltext` endpoints from the desktop app, so they need no cloud key when it is running. Group libraries, and everything when the app is closed, go to the cloud Web API. `set` is a write and always goes to the cloud.

## `zotero_sync`
The version-based delta the Zotero sync algorithm uses. Given `since` (a library version, 0 = everything), returns per-type maps of changed keys (items/collections/searches/tags) plus the deletion log. Fetch only the changed keys afterward — don't re-pull the whole library.

## `zotero_attachment`
Upload, download, or inspect attachment files. File bytes go to/from **disk**, never through the conversation.
- `upload` — store a file via the full 5-step Zotero File Storage protocol (compute md5/mtime → request authorization → upload bytes → register). Give `url` to have Zoteus fetch the file itself, or `file_path` for a file on the machine running Zoteus. Optional `parent_item`, `title`, `content_type`. Returns the new attachment key (and whether the file already existed in storage).
- `download` — fetch an attachment's file to `save_path` (default under the Zoteus data dir); returns the path and byte count.
- `info` — return an attachment item's metadata.

> Uploads/downloads use the cloud Web API and count against your Zotero file-storage quota. For a **key-free** store into the running desktop app, use `zotero_attach_file` instead.
>
> `file_path` is a path on the machine running **Zoteus**, not the machine you are chatting from. On a remote or hosted server those are different machines, so use `url` there.

## `zotero_attach_file`
Store a file as a stored attachment under an existing item. Give `parent` (the item key) and either `url` (Zoteus downloads it, then stores it) or `path` (a file on the machine running Zoteus); `filename` and `content_type` are inferred when omitted, `title` defaults to the filename. arXiv-style URLs carry no extension, so one is appended from the served content type. Returns the new attachment key.

Two backends, picked per call:

- **Desktop** (Zotero 10+ local-API writes) whenever the app is reachable: no cloud key, no storage quota, and the bytes never go through the Web API. Stored as `imported_file`.
- **Cloud** (the Web API's File Storage protocol) otherwise, or for a group library via `library_id`. Needs `ZOTERO_API_KEY` with file access and counts against your Zotero storage quota. A downloaded file is stored as `imported_url` keeping its source URL, which is what Zotero itself records for a PDF pulled off the web.

On Zotero 9 and earlier (a read-only local API) the desktop attempt fails before anything is created, so the call retries on the cloud when a key is configured. A failure *after* the attachment item exists is reported instead of retried, since a second attempt would leave the empty first one behind.

> **Remote and hosted servers.** The desktop local API listens on `127.0.0.1:23119` on **your** machine, so a Zoteus running anywhere else has no route to it and no amount of granting write access in Zotero will change that. There, the cloud path is the only one, and `url` is the way in: the server fetches the bytes itself rather than needing a file on its own disk. See [`writing.md`](./writing.md) for the desktop write paths and the one-time key grant.

## `zotero_annotate`
Add or delete Zotero PDF annotations (highlights, underlines, notes), the same objects the PDF reader creates, so they appear in Zotero's reader sidebar and export with the item. `parent` may be a regular item key (the PDF child is resolved for you) or an attachment key. Highlights need only `text`, the passage itself: Zoteus locates it in the PDF and computes the page rects Zotero anchors a highlight by, following it across line and column breaks. An explicit `position` (`{"pageIndex":N,"rects":[[x1,y1,x2,y2],…]}` in native PDF points, bottom-left origin) overrides that. `annotationSortIndex` is derived from wherever the passage lands. `action:"delete"` trashes annotations by key. Routes to the desktop app for the personal library, else the cloud Web API. Details and examples in [`writing.md`](./writing.md).
